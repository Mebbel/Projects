# -> that is automatically POSITIVE returns!!!
# > SO I JUST BUY AT whatever price every evning a 0DTE
# And sell it at whatever price the next evening? WHAT?
# TEST THIS!!

# Calculate actual RoI -> 
# Assume 1.000â‚¬ Investment
# -> Always invest 30% of cash each evening?

# Infer 6month trend -> DO NOT bet against the trend!
# -> Suspend buyorders if there is no clear direction and / or not enough volatility in the index

# THEN! How to increase profit? Tactial sell orders?
# -> Put ludicrous sell-orders -> close + 3%?
# Infer from history!

# Adjust maturity? -> how does this behave with almost 0DTE orders?
# -> i.e. 3-5 days to maturity?
# -> THIS IS Not always available! -> use max leverage of 20/30 -> that's more safe for backtesting!




# Adjust holding period?! Hold 1,2,3,4,5,... days?
# -> Hold to maturity? Just roll the option? 
# -> Or sell them always 5-10 days BEFORE maturity?


# Compare! To buy and hold
# Underlying index
# Buy and hold options longer term!
