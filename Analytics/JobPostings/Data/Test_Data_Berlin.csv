We are building a ""data pipeline as a service"" service that aims to deliver raw data, reports, and automated decisions to our clients' data warehouses or tools. We do this around a business niche - mobile marketing - that involves highly generalizable business processes and tall amounts of data. This will allow you to work on the BI of multiple companies at once. This position is ideally in Berlin, but remote can be considered.

Who Are We And What Do We Do

The largest app stores in the West, Google Play, Apple Store, Windows Store and Amazon Appstore, have nearly 6,000,000 million apps(!) That’s a lot of competition if you’d like to get noticed and that’s where Tenjin can help.

For User Acquisition Specialists, Data Analysts and Marketers fighting through the noise and gaining the attention of potential mobile users in this hyper-competitive market is a challenge. To succeed you need a Growth Data Infrastructure (GDI) so that user data analysis may be turned into profitable actions. This is expensive and at Tenjin we help democratize the possibility of success for new and upcoming apps by offering a much more economical GDI solution. We have helped some of your (and the world’s) biggest apps.

You might not see us, but we have a powerful presence in the industry and have developed a highly regarded reputation within the gaming and mobile advertising ecosystem globally. Remote working is in our DNA. We are a diverse and highly collaborative team-based all around the world. Our Headquarters are in San Francisco and Berlin, but we also have team members based in Atlanta, Chicago, Toronto, Shanghai, London, and Tokyo.

What You’ll Do

ETL and data warehousing: You will be building ETL pipelines or analytical jobs as part of Game Data Pipes ""data pipeline as a service"" service that we are creating. Coordinating data updates between our external data sources, our primary data warehouse, and our customer data warehouses is a big part of the challenge. Extensive experience in Python and SQL is required. Experience with Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake or similar systems is a big plus. You will take charge of data modeling for scale and easy maintenance.
Dashboard reporting analytics: Delivering actionable analytics to our clients is a big part of what we do. We aim to get meaningful, trusted metrics in front of them as quickly as possible using various BI tools depending on our customer’s choice: Tableau, Looker, Metabase, Mode, Google Data Studio, Periscope...

Who You Are

Scope and Complexity: You've mastered several technologies and are able to onboard others. You can independently manage technical aspects of multiple projects with increasing complexity.
Communication and People Skills: You can explain complex technical problems to non-technical people, and can present problems and solutions to management.
Technical Skills: You understand best practices in loading data, the various strategies you can use for incremental loading, idempotence and data modeling. You can describe or implement pipelines yourself.
Ownership and Impact: You pay attention to details (QA) and enjoy delivering accurate analytics. You'll partner closely with the product to manage the scope and deliverables for the technical side of the roadmap. You will quickly assess what will help or hinder an initiative.
